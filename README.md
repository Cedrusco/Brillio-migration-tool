> Generate reports on various migration types

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-mq using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g ./
```

## Configuration
For mq migrations, reconfigure the pattern and its approximate complexity to migrate to AWS MQ in the 
```bash
./generators/app/templates/patterns.json
```

## Run
Check the complexity to migrate your project:

```bash
yo mq
```
And follow the instructions of the generator.

## Results
### MQ Migration
You will find a Summary.json file in the root of your project to explain the complexity of migration.

### PCF Migration
You will find a pcf-report.json and pcf-report.xlsx in the root directory of you project or in the path you ran the tool.
