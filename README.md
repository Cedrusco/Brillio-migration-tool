> Checking the complexity of migrating from IBM MQ to AWS MQ

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-mq using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-mq
```

## Configuration
Reconfigure the pattern and its approximate complexity to migrate to AWS MQ in the 
```bash
./generators/app/templates/patterns.json
```

## Run
Then check the complexity to migrate your project:

```bash
yo mq
```
And follow the instructions of the generator.
At the end, you will find a Summary.json file in the root of your project to explain the complexity of migration.
